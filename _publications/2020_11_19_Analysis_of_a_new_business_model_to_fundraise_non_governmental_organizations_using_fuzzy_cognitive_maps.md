**Abstract**: Fundraising is one of the most critical issues for non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to carry out their projects. In this paper, a search engine project which aims to find additional financial sources and increase donations for NGOs is proposed. The proposed search engine project is analyzed using fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) to define and manage factor influences on the success of the project. FCMs are useful tools to define long term effects of important factors for a system. First casual relations of the factors are determined and then using sigmoid function for learning algorithm, the equilibrium state for the system is obtained. It is found that the factors generating monetary values are the most important ones for the project to be successful in long term.
