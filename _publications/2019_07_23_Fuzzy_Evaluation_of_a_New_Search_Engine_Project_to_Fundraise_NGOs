Abstract: Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) mostly use donations to fundraise their projects. In general, to increase the donations there is a need for a platform that brings the donators, members and NGOs together. In this paper, a new search engine project is proposed that uses the advertising incomes through user searches to fundraise several NGOs. In addition, it enables the users to get information about the projects of fundraised NGOs and the amount of the money needed for these projects. By this way, it increases social awareness. In this paper, at first, the cost parameters of this social project are determined and the economic feasibility of the project is investigated using fuzzy breakeven analysis.
